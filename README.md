# Arkanoid
Arkanoid game made on SDL2.

The game has a few bugs and lacks certain features, it's NOT a complete product.

Use this as you please! I hope this helps anyone who wants to learn game development using SDL2 and C++.

In order to run this game you must include the following dynamic loading libraries to the executable's folder.

SDL2.dll
SDL2_image.dll
SDL2_ttf.dll
zlib1.dll
libfreetype-6.dll
libpng16-16.dll

Also be sure to include a font of your choice and a PNG file for your ball.

Have a good one!
